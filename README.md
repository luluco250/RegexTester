RegexTester
===========

A simple program to test regex expressions.

While you can build it with any compiler you want, it comes with a small meson build project that you can use.

To use, simply call: 
```
regex "[expression]" "[string]"
```

Quotes are recommended because certain regex characters may be confused with terminal commands.

You can call:
```
regex cheatsheet
```
